# Mental Health in Tech: Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a multi-page Power BI dashboard built on the 2014 Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset. The goal is to explore mental health challenges in the tech industry, with a focus on treatment access, work-life interference, employer support, and demographic patterns.

The dashboard aims to support awareness, decision-making, and workplace advocacy by translating raw survey data into interactive visual narratives.
